Summary: comparisons.

me: idle thought: why on earth isn't "strcmp" called "strdiff" ?  How many bugs would be fixed with that?
everyone thinks of comparing, by default, as comparing for similarity
Nik: true dat
me: omg I should totally like blog that, innit, yeah, know what I mean?
Nik: though the int-->bool translation is a culprit there too
me: That is partially to blame, yes
