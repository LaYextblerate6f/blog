A very quick update here, but for those not on Facebook or Twitter, we've announced the name of Godbolt v2.0 --- his name is Isaac Benjamin Godbolt.

Isaac (or Zac for short) is doing well, he's putting on weight and Mum has recovered well. William continues to be a lovely big brother to the "babby", though he can't say Isaac or even Zac. The best he can do is "Zatt", which will do for now!
