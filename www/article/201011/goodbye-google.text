Summary: Goodbye Google
Label: Blog

It's a sad day today: my last day working for Google. I've had such a great time and it's sad to wave goodbye to all my friends, and leave behind all the cool and exciting secret projects.

So very excited about the new few weeks though --- Ness and I are off to Chicago at the weekend (first time away without the kids) to house-hunt and generally enjoy ourselves.  Then back to the UK and my first day in the new job!
