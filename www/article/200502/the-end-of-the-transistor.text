According to <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/01/transistor_replacement/">The
Register</a>, scientists at HP have found a new way of making low-level logic
gates like NOT, AND and OR.  These devices are much smaller and simpler than
transistors apparently, maybe heralding a new wave of chip fabrication
techniques.
