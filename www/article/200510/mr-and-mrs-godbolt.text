We're back!  We had an **amazing** time in Cyprus and Ness and I are now
officially Mr and Mrs Godbolt!

<p align="center"><img width="480" height="360"

write more when I get time, and I'll upload a few more pics --- we have
hundreds!  A huge thank you to all those who made it out to Cape Greco --- you
really made our day so very special.
