Back home...boo hoo!  At least I've had decent internet connectivity, so I've
uploaded a few more photos onto our <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.godbolt">online album</a> for your
viewing pleasure.  With 6.5GB of photographs these are pretty much a random
selection; once we've sorted through them a bit more I'll do a tidied-up version
with the best pictures.
