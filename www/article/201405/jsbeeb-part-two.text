Summary: More notes on what goes on when you emulate a BBC Micro computer in javascript
Label: Coding

Following on from my [previous post][pp], I'm going to talk a bit about
emulating the video hardware of a BBC Micro. Firstly, a big credit to Tom
Walker for his [b-em][bem] emulator upon which much of the jsbeeb video code is
based. Thanks Tom!

The video hardware
------------------

When most people think of a BBC Micro, they think of the iconic
"[Teletext][tt]" display, referred to as MODE 7. It was the default screen
mode and had some great benefits: it had high-resolution, clear text, many
colours, and some cool effects. The fact it only took up 1KB of memory was
nice too, especially when that may be 1/16th of your whole RAM.

MODE 7 was supplied by a separate chip from the rest of the screen modes, and
although it's very interesting and complex, it's not what I'm going to talk
about today. I'm going to talk about the rest of the video circuitry; the
graphics modes provided by the [6845CRTC][crtc], in combination with a custom
video ULA which provided timings and palette configuration.

TODO [crtc]: TODO link to wiki

The 6502 CPU communicated with the 6845 by writing to its memory mapped area
at `0xfe00` to `0xfe07`. The 6845 has 18 internal registers and to access them
one would write the address number to `0xfe00` and then the value required to
`0xfe01`. (The other addresses in the range mapped to the same two functions).

The registers control things like where the television sync pulse would be
generated, when and where horizontal lines would start and end, and what
memory address the bitmapped screen was stored at. By judicious programming 
of the start of screen memory, games could perform
hardware scrolling, albeit at a somewhat coarse level of 8 pixels in the X
direction.

[jsbeeb][] operates in a physical PAL TV space of 1280x768 pixels. This allows it
to account for things like the vertical sync pulse being configurable. At the
end of each frame, the area of the 1280x768 that actually contained pixels is
then blitted to a 698x571 canvas element. The unusual size is to purposefully
blur the pixels a little to simulate an authentic TV experience.

[jsbeeb]: http://bbc.godbolt.org) "Lovely, isn't it?"

Every clock cycle (of the 2MHz clock), then 6845 processes one byte of screen
memory, generating anywhere from two to eight logical pixels, depending on the number
of colours per pixel and other register settings. In jsbeeb's terms, each tick
generates between eight and sixteen physical pixels in PAL space.

On each clock cycle, jsbeeb looks at all the hardware registers again,
determines which settings are in effect, and renders either 8 or 16 32-bpp
pixels into its buffer. The video code runs every time the CPU emulator calls 
its `polltime()`, making it a kind of co-routine with the CPU (along with the
other peripheral emulators).

The reason the state is re-checked each cycle is
because it was very common for games to alter the settings mid-frame by clever
use of well-timed interrupts to, for example, scroll part of the screen, or
change the palette of colours available halfway down the screen.

Checking each time is a little inefficient -- as is ticking the screen code every
time the CPU counter ticks. In future updates I plan on accumulating screen
clock cycles and running the screen for longer batches if and only if I know
for certain none of the registers have changed. At this point I can also
consider better code arrangements to take advantage of rendering multiple
screen pixels with the same settings.

The framebuffer object written to is a 32-bpp overlay on the 8-bpp underlying
canvas's framebuffer.  This lets me write a single 32-bpp value to set a whole
pixel. The mappings between the BBC's colour format and the 32-bpp values
required are all done only when the palette registers are written to, instead
of each time a colour is needed, which is a nice optimization.

In spite of the complexity, the performance of the screen code is suprisingly
good. It does appear near the top of the profiles but upon further
investigation a lot of the time is spent at the end of each frame in the
blitting code that takes the area of the PAL physical screen that was rendered
to and stretch blits it into the actual canvas object displayed on the web
page.
