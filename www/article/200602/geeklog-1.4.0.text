Yay --- <a href="http://www.geeklog.net">GeekLog</a> <a
href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/geeklog-1.4.0">1.4.0</a> has released
--- xania.org has now been updated to use the full release instead of the
release candidate.

The update was pretty damn simple --- according to the <a
href="http://www.geeklog.net/article.php/geeklog-1.4.0">instructions</a>, only a
few files had changed and there was no database update.  The update page listed
all the files that had changed, but I had a better idea --- I downloaded the RC2
and 1.4.0 tars, and unpacked them.  I then made a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> (diff -rupN) of the two
folders, piped it through <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_%28Unix%29">patch</a> on the live setup
(with appropriate -p setting) and <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bob1.htm">Bob's your uncle</a> --- all sorted!  The first time I've used
diff/patch on a live system and it worked first time!
