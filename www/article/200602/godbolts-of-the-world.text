Godbolts of the World

When you're a self-promoting, self-obsessed blog whore like me, you spend a lot
of time googling for your own name.  Along the way I've discovered that my
surname, Godbolt, isn't half as unique as I've always thought.

I've always enjoyed having an unusual name.  Recently, more and more people are
asking my wife and I where the name comes from.  According to my Dad through his
own research and that of his uncle and aunt, the name is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> and has two
possible derivations.  The one that gets my vote is a form of 'good bolt' or
'good bold', being a good archer or fletcher or just generally an adventurous
type.  Rather an appealing heritage, I'm sure you'll agree.  The other
possibility (favoured by my father) is again 'good bolt' but bolt taking to mean
the bolting (jumping and acrobatics) of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_jester">court jester</a>.  I'm not so
convinced myself, though my wife seems to think it's a good fit!

So anyway, I've been amazed at the number of other Godbolts there are out there.
I've noticed that they're predominantly black Americans.  Rather shamefully it
would appear this is because someone *way* back in our family was either in the
slave business, or else owned a fair few slaves.  Apparently it was common
practice for freed slaves to take on the name of their previous owner or master.
Quite an unpleasant episode in the history of the Godbolts.

I'd like to make a list of all the Godbolts on the internet.  As a starting
point:

...and many more --- these are just the tip of the Godbolt iceberg!  I'm quite amazed, I'd
realised there were more out there than I thought, but in the process of
researching this article I've found so many more!  There are <a

Godbolts</a> in America alone, so this page might get quite big if I put them
all in!
